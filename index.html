                    We seriously considered naming this place Two Lebanese sisters.  After my sister Sheila  and I. We are half Lebanese and it sounded like a great name after a few beers. Well maybe it was just me that was seriously considering it. I pictured our logo being us each serving a mug with beer sloshing out of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides Two Lebanese Sisters we did toss around hundreds of different names. Sheila my sister, and Ian her better half and my brother in law (and also the other owners of this place) would call up and say I got it!  Then we would all mull the name over for a week or so before deciding it just wasn't it. Chad, my better half, had a lot of ideas usually all patriotic themed, they usually had something to do with an eagle or a flag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We finally stumbled on Leatherhead and pretty much everyone of us credits ourselves with thinking of the name. After all I know it was me and that's really the important thing here.  Actually as much as it pains me to say it I think it was Chad's idea. But honestly after brainstorming so many different names for months I was happy we finally found a name that we all loved and sounded like "us". <span class="stronger">Leatherhead Brewing Company.</span> We are trying to incorporate all of our four colorful personalities into the place, and I truthfully think that a Mexican themed German bar with an old rustic new aged feel is going to be what Green Bay has always needed. No in all truthfulness we have something cool in the mix and we hope you will come check is out in September.

                <h3>The Brewery's Beginnings</h3>
                <p class="datestamp">
                    July 28th, 2015

                <p>
                    It all started with Jake’s beer.  I’d be lying if I said it grew out of some need for better beer in Green Bay, because the truth is we’ve got great beer here.  But this beer, this beer was different.  We sat outside on the patio at Jake’s brewery in Milwaukee and seriously considered not going to the Brewers game just so we could have one more.  It was after that when we decided this beer had to be in Green Bay, mostly just so we could drink more of it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the stout that got us.  It started with the two of us just sneaking over to the brewery to have a pint whenever we were in town.  Then, I found myself packing a cooler full of ice and making a special trip into Milwaukee when I was passing through just to pick up a Growler. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there we had it, we just had to start a brewery in our hometown.  And luckily, the brewer was on board, not the one that plays baseball, but the one that brews the awesome beer.  Cousin Jake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can’t wait for you to try Jake’s beer too.   Come on in and have one of Jake’s beers with us when we open—we’ll have one waiting for you.

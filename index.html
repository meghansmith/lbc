                <h3>The brewery's beginnings</h3>
                <p class="datestamp">

                <p>
                    It all started with Jake’s beer.  I’d be lying if I said it grew out of some need for better beer in Green Bay, because the truth is we’ve got great beer here.  But this beer, this beer was different.  We sat outside on the patio at Jake’s brewery in Milwaukee and seriously considered not going to the Brewers game just so we could have one more.  It was after that when we decided this beer had to be in Green Bay, mostly just so we could drink more of it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the stout that got us.  It started with the two of us just sneaking over to the brewery to have a pint whenever we were in town.  Then, I found myself packing a cooler full of ice and making a special trip into Milwaukee when I was passing through just to pick up a Growler. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there we had it, we just had to start a brewery in our hometown.  And luckily, the brewer was on board, not the one that plays baseball, but the one that brews the awesome beer.  Cousin Jake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can’t wait for you to try Jake’s beer too.   Come on in and have one of Jake’s beers with us when we open—we’ll have one waiting for you.
